To run this file you need to have python3 installed, I wrote this in python 3.10 but I think it works on older versions.

I suggest creating a venv and running this through it
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
If you're on windows run the script in \.venv\Scripts for your respective terminal and installing the pip requirments using
```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```
If you're on Bash and Linux run this command to enter the .venv:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Only the pip packages left: <br>
If youre using something like Anaconda or Spyder then idk, figure it out yourself :D <br>
The only dependancies for this is numpy and matplotlib, so make sure you 
do both:
```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```
